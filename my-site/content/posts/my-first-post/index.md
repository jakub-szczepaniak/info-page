This is my first post on this blog. I do not have any specific plan on the topics I want to cover. I see these pages as a way to remember the things I did and how I made it work. I also do not expect anyone else than Future Me to read these words. So if you, Dear Reader, are here, it means my time machine worked and you can go back to the time these words were written.

This will be also quite challenging journey for me, as I need to learn and figure out how to use Hugo to present the content in a way that I think makes sense. For now, I am stuck at rendering the list of posts in the `/posts/` section. 

*Update*: I have managed to figure it out. Basically, my content `type` was `post`, but the layouts in the theme were defined for `type : posts`. All good now!
