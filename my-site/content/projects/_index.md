### List of my projects

#### Crafting Interpreter in Rust

I want to learn Rust and i decided the best way would be to follow excellent book from [Robert Nystrom](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/)
on [Crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and use it as a base for my own take on the interpreter/compiler but written in Rust.
Repository : [Lox-rs](https://github.com/jakub-szczepaniak/lox-rs)
Status: in progress (have a working function call/declaration)
